## User Story

As a dessert lover

I can search for dessert keywords

So that I can satisfy my craving

## Overview

For our first group project we were asked to come together as a team to solve a
real world problem using data from multiple server-side API requests.

### Goals:

- Work together as a group
- Create a functional app to search for dessert recipes
- Navigate the murky waters of a shared GitHub repo

### Kanban

After the start of the project it quickly became apperant that each member of
the team liked to have a clear idea of which step they should be working on
next. Kanban, being built into GitHub, came in as a great tool for us. We worked
together to break down the project into simple steps, and moved the steps from our
personal to-do lists into the "done" bucket.

### Two Server-Side APIs

We chose to work with Edamam and Spoonacular for the first time.

Edamam provided us with a json object to manipulate that allowed us to display
the recipe title, image, and link. With each user search we were able to limit
the search to three responses, as well as limit by vegan desserts, peanut free
desserts, and tree nut free desserts.

As happy as desserts make everyone, we knew we needed to bring more joy to the
world. That's where Spoonacular's Get A Random Food Joke came in. Caution: user 
discretion is advised!

### CSS Framework: Skeleton

The team loved working in Skeleton. Unlike Bootstrap, the documentation for
Skeleton was easily digestable, and it's file is cleanly written and simple
to look at and understand. We were still able to create a responsive and great
layout, while giving us the space to explore our own design styles.

### New Third-Party API

Once the project had started to really take shape, the team knew we needed
something to create a more beautifully interactive application. With the use of
Jquery UI we were able to add some really exciting features.

- Predictive search Using the Cupcake Ipsum's array of delicious dessert
  options, we implimented the ability to choose from a list of suggested search
  terms after the user begins typing. We added to the array to make it even more
  accessible, and styled the drop down to fit with the rest of our page's
  styling

- An effect called Shake was added to the div container for the jokes. Upon clicking 
  it the div "shakes" and presents a new joke on the screen

- Hide and Effect used to dynamically display divs on the page, and have them shift
  up after the first search
