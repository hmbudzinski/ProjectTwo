## User Story

As a person who enjoys nerdy activities

I want to be able to find other people who enjoy nerdy activities

So that I can do those nerdy activities with them! 

## Overview

For our second group project we were asked to come together as a team to create a working application that can push to and pull from a databse. 

### Goals:

- Work together as a group
- Create a functional app to find friends
- Learn new technoligies and utilize them in the app 

### New Tecnhologies 

For our new tech on this app we chose to work with Passport for authentication, Slick for the carousel, handlebars for structuring the carousel, and AWS for uploading images.

### CSS Framework: Materialize

A couple of our team members used Materialized on their first project but did not get much exposure to it as they were on the backend teams, therefore we decided to use it again in this project so everyoe could fully understand and be exposed to it. Similarly to Bootstrap, the documentation for Materialize is easy to maneuver in terms of finding what we needed, but it was a bit more difficult when it came to structuring the full html and styling.

### Strengths and Difficulties 

Our team worked very well together and listened to eachothers ideas and input throughout the whole project. The ability to do this made for smooth sailing when it came to task delegation and making decisions. 

We struggled with debugging on this project, it felt like when we fixed one thing another thing would break, but we were able to come together in the end to get it done. 

### Future Goals 

In the future of this project, we would like to add the function of being able to message users you match with, be able to save users you match with, be able to view other users profiles from the swipe page, and be able to filter by specific attributes on the swipe page. We would also like to potentially add a romantic side to the app that makes it more of a dating site, add geolocation so users only see those in a certain amount of distance from them, and add the function of the user being able to post status updates, similarly to a blog, so then when you view a users page you can see their posts as well.
